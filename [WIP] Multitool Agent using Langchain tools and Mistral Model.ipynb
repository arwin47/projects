      "              ToolMessage(content=\"Page: 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election\\nSummary: The Fourteenth Legislative Assembly Election was held on 13 April 2011 to elect members from 234 constituencies in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Results were released on 13 May 2011. Two major parties Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) faced the election as coalitions of multiple political parties: DMK front consisted of 8 parties and the AIADMK of 11 parties. Vijayakanth's Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK), which had contested the previous elections independently, allied with the AIADMK coalition. Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam boycotted the election following a disagreement with Jayalalithaa over seat-sharing. \\nThe outgoing Karunanidhi government was noted for the construction of new assembly building in Chennai, and issuance of a range of freebies such as color television to all. However, these were heavily overshadowed by other major issues such as incessant power cuts in households and industries, excessive sand mining, increasing prices of essential items, 2G spectrum case and undue influence of Karunanidhi's extended family in various aspects of Tamil politics and business and even media.\\n\\n \\nThe election commission enforced stringent measures to curb the widespread abuse of power to bribe voters that were common in previous elections; it also imposed strict campaign discipline by imposing the 10 PM curfew.\\nThe election recorded the highest polling ever in the state - 77.8% of the total electorate voted in the election surpassing 76.57% polled in 1967 election\\nThe AIADMK-led front won the election with a decisive victory, securing 203 constituencies. The AIADMK alone achieved a landslide majority with 150 seats, enabling it to form the government without coalition support. The DMDK won 29 seats, surpassing the DMK’s 23, and chose to serve as the official opposition. Political analysts viewed the results as a referendum on the outgoing DMK government, with strong anti-incumbency sentiment propelling the AIADMK coalition to victory. On 16 May 2011, J. Jayalalithaa was sworn in as Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu for the fourth time, along with 33 ministers, by governor Surjit Singh Barnala.\\n\\nPage: 2026 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election\\nSummary: Legislative Assembly elections are expected to be held in Tamil Nadu in April–May 2026 to elect all 234 members of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.\\n\\nPage: 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election\\nSummary: The Sixteenth Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Election was held on 6 April 2021, to elect representatives from the 234 constituencies in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) won the election, ending the decade-long reign of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The DMK's leader M. K. Stalin became the eighth Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and the 12th Chief Minister since the 1956 reorganization. He replaced Edappadi K. Palaniswami of the AIADMK.\\nThe poll was Tamil Nadu's first assembly election after the demises of the two most prominent Chief Ministers in the state's modern history, J. Jayalilithaa—general secretary of the AIADMK, and M. Karunanidhi—president of the DMK, who died in 2016 and 2018 respectively. With the AIADMK winning the 2016 election, Jayalalithaa became the Chief Minister and served for almost six months. Upon her death, O. Panneerselvam took charge as the Chief Minister, shortly after which Palaniswami was sworn in instead in 2017, who served till the end of the 15th assembly's tenure. The Election Commission of India announced the schedule for the elections to the 16th Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly on 26 February 2021.\\nThe DMK continued its Secular Progressive Alliance (SPA) with the Indian National Congress, the Communist parties and many others, and named Stalin as its candidate for the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister's Office. The AIADMK joined the National Democratic Alliance\", name='wikipedia', id='b16421c9-051e-4502-bf40-c94a9d75064a', tool_call_id='6f1a920e-1a9c-408b-b10d-77a477498bf4'),\n",
