       "**Paleolithic Period (c. 2.5 million - 10,000 BCE)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The Great Indian Desert was an important source of archaeological materials in the late 20th century.\n",
       "* Hand axes found at Didwana, Rajasthan, and other sites date back to around 400,000 years ago.\n",
       "* Mesolithic cultures are evident throughout India, with a wide variety of subsistence patterns, including hunting, gathering, fishing, herding, and small-scale agriculture.\n",
       "* Many caves in central India contain rock paintings depicting various subjects, including game animals and human activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Mesolithic Period (c. 10,000 - 5,000 BCE)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The progressive diminution in the size of stone artifacts reached its climax with the small parallel-sided blades and microliths of what has been called the Indian Mesolithic.\n",
       "* Cultures during this period exhibited a wide variety of subsistence patterns, including hunting, gathering, fishing, and herding.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Neolithic Period (c. 5,000 - 2,000 BCE)**\n",
       "\n",
       "* The Indo-Iranian borderlands form the eastern extension of the Iranian plateau and mirror the environment of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East.\n",
       "* Excavations at Mehrgarh in Baluchistan provided evidence of early settlements on the borders of the Indus system and Baluchistan, with two major periods of occupation dating back to around 8,000 BCE.\n",
       "* The first examples of pottery, granary structures, and monumental architecture appeared during this period.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Other Sites**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Sarai Khola (Pakistan Punjab) had the earliest known settlements, dating back to around 4,000 BCE.\n",
       "* Burzahom in the Vale of Kashmir also had early settlements, with deep pit dwellings associated with ground stone axes and bone tools.\n",
       "* Gufkral, another site in the Kashmir region, has been dated by radiocarbon to the 3rd millennium BCE.\n",
