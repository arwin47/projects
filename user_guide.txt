   The appliance you have purchased is designed for domestic use only.  
 Using the appliance for business purposes qualifies as an appliance misuse. In this case, the appliance will 
not be covered by the standard warranty provided by Samsung and no responsibility can be attributed to 
Samsung for malfunctions or damages resulting from such misuse.   
 Do not stand on the appliance or place objects (such as laundry, lighted candles, lighted cigarettes, dishes, 
chemicals, metal objects, etc.) on the appliance.  
    This may result in electric shock, fire, problems with the appliance, or injury.

clinics.  
    This may cause the rubber seal to become deformed and result in a water leak.  
   Do not leave metal objects such as safety pins, hair pins or bleach in the drum for long periods of time.  
    This may cause the drum to rust.  
    If rust starts appearing on the surface of the drum, apply a (neutral) cleansing agent to the surface and 
use a sponge to clean it. Never use a metal brush.  
   Do not use dry cleaning detergent directly and do not wash, rinse, or spin laundry contaminated by dry 
cleaning detergent.  
    This may result in spontaneous combustion or ignition due to the heat from the oxidation of the oil.  
   Do not use water from water cooling/heating devices.  
    This may result in problems with the washing machine.  
   Do not use natural hand-washing soap for the washing machine.  
    If it hardens and accumulates inside the washing machine, it may result in problems with the appliance, 
discolouration, rust, or bad odours.  
   Place socks and brassieres in a washing net and wash them with the other laundry.  
 Do not wash large laundry items such as bedding in the washing net.  
    Failure to do so may result in injury due to abnormal vibrations.

 Do not modify the provided plug. If it does not fit 
the outlet, call a qualified electrician to install a 
proper outlet.  
 WARNING   
     Do NOT use an extension cord.  
    Use only the power cord that comes with the 
washing machine.  
    Do NOT connect the ground wire to plastic 
plumbing, gas lines, or hot water pipes.  
    Improperly connected grounding conductors 
may cause electric shock.      
   Water supply  
 A proper water pressure for this washing machine 
is between 50 kPa and 800 kPa. Water pressure 
less than 50 kPa may cause the water valve not to 
close completely. Or, it may take longer to fill the 
drum, causing the washing machine to turn off. 
Water taps must be within 120 cm from the rear 
of the washing machine so that the provided inlet 
hoses reach the washing machine.  
 To reduce the risk of leaks:  
    Make sure water taps are easily accessible.  
    Turn off the taps when the washing machine is 
not in use.  
    Check for any leaks at the water inlet hose 
fittings on a regular basis.  
   CAUTION   
  Before using the washing machine for the first 
time, check all connections at the water valve and 
taps for any leaks.   
     Drain  
 Samsung recommends a standpipe in height of 60-
90 cm. The drain hose must be connected through 
the hose clip to the standpipe, and the standpipe 
must fully cover the drain hose.

   Flooring  
 For best performance, the washing machine must 
be installed on a solid floor. Wood floors may need 
to be reinforced to minimise vibration and/or 
unbalanced loads. Carpeting and soft tile surfaces 
are not a good resistance to vibrations and may 
cause the washing machine to move slightly during 
the spin cycle.  
 CAUTION   
  Do NOT install the washing machine on a platform 
or a poorly supported structure.   
     Water temperature  
 Do not install the washing machine in areas where 
water may freeze as the washing machine always 
retains some water in its water valves, pumps, and/
or hoses. Frozen water left in the connection parts 
may cause damage to belts, the pump, and other 
components of the washing machine.   
   Alcove or closet installation  
 Minimum clearance for stable operation:  
 Sides   25 mm  
 Top   25 mm  
 Rear   50 mm  
 Front   550 mm  
 If both the washing machine and a dryer are 
installed in the same location, the front of the 
alcove or closet must have at least a 550 mm 
unobstructed air opening. Your washing machine 
alone does not require a specific air opening.

      Laundry guidelines  
STEP1     Sort  
  Sort the laundry according to these criteria:  
    Care Label: Sort the laundry into cottons, mixed fibres, synthetics, silks, wools, and rayon.  
    Colour: Separate whites from colours.  
    Size: Mixing different sized items together in the drum improves the washing performance.  
    Sensitivity: Wash delicate items separately using an Easy Iron option for pure, new woollen items, 
curtains, and silk items. Check the labels on the items.  
   NOTE   
  Make sure to check the care label on the clothing, and sort them accordingly before starting the wash.   
STEP2         Empty pockets  
  Empty all the pockets of your laundry items  
    Metal objects such as coins, pins, and buckles on clothing may damage other laundry items as well as 
the drum.  
     Turn clothing with buttons and embroideries inside out  
    If pants or jacket zippers are open while washing, the drum may be damaged. Zippers should be closed 
and fixed with a string.  
    Clothing with long strings may become entangled with other clothes. Make sure to tie the strings before 
starting the wash.  
STEP3          Use a laundry net  
    Brassieres (water washable) must be placed in a laundry net. Metal parts of the brassieres may break 
through and tear other laundry items.  
    Small, light clothing such as socks, gloves, stockings, and handkerchiefs may become caught around the 
door. Place them inside a fine laundry net.  
    Do not wash the laundry net by itself without other laundry. This may cause abnormal vibrations that 
could move the washing machine and result in injury.

STEP4          Prewash  (if necessary)  
 Select the   Prewash   option for the selected cycle if the laundry is heavily soiled. When selecting the   Prewash   
option, make sure to put powder-type detergent into the main wash compartment.  
STEP5       Determine the load capacity  
 Do not overload the washing machine. Overloading may cause the washing machine to not wash properly. 
For the load capacity for the type of clothing, see page 39. 
 NOTE   
  When washing bedding or bedding covers, the wash time may be lengthened or the spin efficiency may be 
reduced. For bedding or bedding covers, the recommended maximum spin cycle speed is 800 rpm, and the 
load capacity is 2.0 kg or less.   
  CAUTION   
     Unbalanced laundry may reduce the spinning performance.   
    Do not slam the door. Close the door gently. Otherwise, the door may not be closed properly.  
   
  CAUTION   
  Make sure the laundry is fully inserted in the drum 
and not caught in the door.    
STEP6       Apply a proper detergent type  
 The type of detergent depends on the type of fabric (cotton, synthetic, delicate items, wool), colour, 
wash temperature, and degree of soiling. Always use low suds laundry detergent, which is designed for 
automatic washing machines.  
 NOTE   
     Follow the detergent manufacturers recommendations based on the weight of the laundry, the degree 
of soiling, and the hardness of the water in your local area. If you are not sure about the water hardness, 
contact a local water authority.  
    Do not use detergent that tends to be hardened or solidified. This detergent may remain after the rinse 
cycle, blocking the drain outlet.  
    CAUTION   
  When washing wool using the   WOOL/DELICATES  cycle, use only a neutral liquid detergent. If used with the 
  WOOL/DELICATES  cycle, powder detergent may remain on the laundry and discolour the laundry.

 NOTE   
     Loading the household washing machine or the household washer-dryer up to the capacity indicated by 
the manufacturer for the respective programmes will contribute to energy and water savings.  
    The noise and remaining moisture content are influenced by the spinning speed: the higher the spinning 
speed in the spinning phase, the higher the noise and the lower the remaining moisture content.  
    The most efficient cycle in terms of energy consumption are generally those that perform at lower 
temperatures and longer duration.
